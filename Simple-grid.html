            <p>Full-stack development is the process of planning and creating both the front-end (client-side) and
                back-end (server-side) elements of a web application. While back-end development deals with managing
                the server-related elements of the website, such as database administration, API development, and
                more, front-end development concentrates on creating engaging user interfaces and providing a rich
